# Personalized Systems

I have personalized Linux and Windows systems with the configuration I want.

# Windows Configuration

I use [Win11Debloat](https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat) to get rid of all Microsoft Telemetry from my Windows/KVM systems.

# Linux Configuration

My Linux setup is based on vanilla distributions, which I modify to my liking. I use a combination of scripts from [trafotin's os-install-scripts](https://gitlab.com/trafotin/os-install-scripts) and my own custom scripts.

# Note on Distros that base on another (Like Ubuntu/Manjaro/Nobara):

I recommend using vanilla distributions(Arch, Debian, Fedora, SUSE) instead of "based-on-something" distros. I say these cause I've already tried using my scripts on distros like Nobara, but not everything worked out of the box.

# MacOS Configuration

I used commands from [OSX-Optimizer](https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-optimizer) and also installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the addition of [Lulu](https://github.com/objective-see/LuLu) with some custom rules to get rid of Apple Telemetry.

I also have the plan of re-making some OSX-VMs, just for testing, I personally recommend using [OSX-KVM](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM) and [ultimate-macOS-KVM
](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM)

# GPU Passthrough

If you want to use GPU passthrough in a VM, I recommend using [quickpassthrough](https://github.com/HikariKnight/quickpassthrough). I use it in my Windows KVMs and has been a pretty neat experience.

Although I have some gaming stores install on my KVMs, I don't use them for gaming (Thanks stupid kernel-level AntiCheat), mostly work with Davinci Resolve and Affinity. I prefer playing games that use it like valorant or warzone on my PS5.

# Linux Config

My Linux setup is simple: GNOME with AMD/Intel GPU. NVIDIA GPUs on Linux are a headache to configure, at least for me XD. I also prefer to use Secure Boot without adding a custom key that I need to re-add everytime I update my kernel. I'm not a fan of KDE,it always broke in my install XD, the most customization I do is changing the wallpaper.

# GNOME JUST WORKS
