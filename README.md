# OS-Scripts-Install
These is just a personal things that I like to do everythime I install an OS in a personall system or VM, thats all, give it a look if you want.

I have Windows, Fedora-Linux and MacOs systems personalized as my likeness.

I tried using these debloater https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat in my .bat for windows but It didnt worked, so I have it here now.

My fedora commands, some are from trafotin Gitlab (https://gitlab.com/trafotin/os-install-scripts) and some are personal mine, just to clarify

The script I have here for Mac is only for VM use, since I use it only in KVM in my Fedora install, please understand if you use it in bare metal you're on your own.(I used the project https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM to create my VM and the commands from https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-optimizer)

If you wanna use gpu passthrough in any vm you create (As I use both in my Mac and Windows KVMs), use the project https://github.com/HikariKnight/quickpassthrough
