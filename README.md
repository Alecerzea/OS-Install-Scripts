# Personalized Systems

I have personalized Linux and Windows systems that cater to my preferences.

# Windows Customization

I use [Win11Debloat](https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat) to get rid of Microsoft Telemetry from my Windows/KVM systems.

# Linux Customization

My Linux setup is based on vanilla distributions, which I customize to my liking. I use a combination of scripts from [trafotin's os-install-scripts](https://gitlab.com/trafotin/os-install-scripts) and my own custom scripts. I prefer this approach because it allows me to strike a balance between stability and customization.

# Note on Base on:

I recommend using vanilla distributions instead of "based-on-something" distros. I've tried using my scripts on distros like Nobara, but sometimes they don't work out of the box.

# GPU Passthrough

If you want to use GPU passthrough in a VM, I recommend using [quickpassthrough](https://github.com/HikariKnight/quickpassthrough). I use it in my Windows KVMs.

Although I have some gaming stores install on my KVMs, I don't use them for gaming. I prefer playing games like valorant or warzone on my PS5.

# Linux Config

My Linux setup is simple: GNOME with AMD/Intel GPU. I avoid NVIDIA GPUs on Linux because they can be a headache to configure. I also prefer to use Secure Boot without adding a custom key that I need to read everytime I update my kernel. I'm not a fan of KDE, and I don't customize my desktop environment much beyond changing the wallpaper.

# GNOME JUST WORKS
