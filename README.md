These is just some personal things that I like to do everythime I install an OS in a personall system or VM/Server/Work, thats all, give it a look if you want.

I have Windows, Linux and MacOs systems personalized as my likeness.

I also use the [Win11Debloat](https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat) to get rid of Microsoft Telemetry.

In regard of my Linux commands, some are from [trafotin's os-install-scripts](https://gitlab.com/trafotin/os-install-scripts) and some are my own.

Kick side note: I don't recommend base-on-something distros, for me it's better to only use vanilla one and add the changes someone wants, having a balance between stability and customization, that's why I have the scripts to convert Silverblue to Bazzite.

The reason why I'm saying these is because I already tried my scripts in some based-on-something-distros, like Nobara, and sometimes not everyting works out of the box, so please consider these.

The Script I have here for Mac is only for VM use, since I use it only in KVM in my Fedora install, please understand if you use it in bare metal you're on your own.

I use [ultimate-macOS-KVM](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM) and [OSX-KVM](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM) to create my Mac-KVMs in Linux and the commands in my Script are from [osx-optimizer](https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-optimizer).

To make the Mac-VMs work in Virt-Manager under Fedora I made this [script](https://gist.github.com/Alecerzea/87a9530a9d16f9845cb071ae42458d99) (Its not needed in Debian nor Arch, rare they are needed in Fedora-Workstation/Silverblue, side note: they work without issues under the terminal).

If you wanna use gpu passthrough in any vm you create (As I use both in my Mac and Windows KVMs), use [quickpassthrough](https://github.com/HikariKnight/quickpassthrough).

I don't use either for gaming,even though I install some gaming stores in case they are needed for any game that for some reason doesnt work in fedora, don't even try neither Valorant nor Warzone under them XD (I just play them in my PS5 BTW).

My Linux config is only GNOME+AMD/Intel GPU, NVIDIA in Linux is a headache to me  and I want Secure boot without adding a key that would mess with my Kernel, KDE isn't a desktop environment I like, idc about the beef of the developers, nor customization(The most I do is change the Wallpaper and done) GNOME just works.
