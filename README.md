These is just some personal things that I like to do everythime I install an OS in a personall system or VM/Server/Work, thats all, give it a look if you want.

I have Windows, Linux and MacOs systems personalized as my likeness.(I'll never add BSD nor Gentoo})

I also use these debloater https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat to get rid of Microsoft Telemetry.

In regard of my Linux commands, some are from trafotin Gitlab (https://gitlab.com/trafotin/os-install-scripts) and some are my own.

My Arch-KVM is only for Cyber-Security use, personally, I don't have enough confidence on myself to main Vanilla Arch, maybe I could change in the future, but's better to be careful.

Kick side note: I don't recommend base-on-something distros, for me it's better to only use vanilla one and add the changes someone wants, to have a balance between stability and customization, that's why I have the scripts to convert Silverblue to Bazzite and Arch to CachyOS.

The Script I have here for Mac is only for VM use, since I use it only in KVM in my Fedora install, please understand if you use it in bare metal you're on your own.

I use two projects https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM and https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM to create my Mac-KVMs in Linux and the commands in my Script are from https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-optimizer.

To make the Mac-VMs work in Virt-Manager under Fedora I made these script to do it https://gist.github.com/Alecerzea/87a9530a9d16f9845cb071ae42458d99 (Its not needed in Debian nor Arch based distros, rare they are needed in Fedora-Workstation/Silverblue, side note: they work without issues under the terminal).

If you wanna use gpu passthrough in any vm you create (As I use both in my Mac and Windows KVMs), use the project https://github.com/HikariKnight/quickpassthrough .

I don't use either for gaming,don't eveb try neither Valorant nor Warzone under them XD (I just play them in my PS5 BTW).

My Linux config is only GNOME+AMD/Intel GPU, NVIDIA in Linux is a headache to me  and I want Secure boot without adding a key that would mess with my Kernel, KDE isn't a desktop environment I like, idc about the beef of the developers, nor customization(The most I do is change the Wallpaper and done) GNOME just works.
