These is just some personal things that I like to do everythime I install an OS in a personall system or VM, thats all, give it a look if you want.(and tell me if I mess up or mispronounce the name of a package XD)

I have Windows, Linux and MacOs systems personalized as my likeness.

I tried using these debloater https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat in my .bat for windows but It didnt worked, so I have it here now.

My Fedora commands, some are from trafotin Gitlab (https://gitlab.com/trafotin/os-install-scripts) and some are personal mine, just to clarify.

My Arch-KVM is only for Cyber-Security use, personally, I don't have enough confidence on myself to main Vanilla Arch or an Arch base distro, maybe I could change in the future, but's better to be careful.

The script I have here for Mac is only for VM use, since I use it only in KVM in my Fedora install, please understand if you use it in bare metal you're on your own.

I use two projects https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM and https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM to create my Mac-KVMs in Fedora and the commands in my script are from https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-optimizer.

To make the Mac-VMs work in Virt-Manager under Fedora I made these script to do it https://gist.github.com/Alecerzea/87a9530a9d16f9845cb071ae42458d99 (Its not needed in Debian nor Arch based distros, rare its needed with Fedora as it works without issues under the terminal).

If you wanna use gpu passthrough in any vm you create (As I use both in my Mac and Windows KVMs), use the project https://github.com/HikariKnight/quickpassthrough .

I don't use either for gaming, please dont try neither Valorant nor Warzone under them (I just play them in my PS5 BTW).

My Linux config is only GNOME+AMD, NVIDIA in Linux is a headache to me  and I want Secure boot without adding a key that would mess with my Kernel, and KDE isn't my favorite desktop environment, idc about the beef of the developers, nor customization(the most I change is the Wallpaper and done) GNOME just works.

I also added some shit for gaming that I'll only keep in Arch, I don't want that kernel to mess with secure boot in my Fedora install (fedora is my main distro).
