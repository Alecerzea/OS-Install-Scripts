These is just some personal things that I like to do everythime I install an OS in a personall system or VM, thats all, give it a look if you want.

I have Windows, Fedora-Linux and MacOs systems personalized as my likeness.

I tried using these debloater https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat in my .bat for windows but It didnt worked, so I have it here now.

My Fedora commands, some are from trafotin Gitlab (https://gitlab.com/trafotin/os-install-scripts) and some are personal mine, just to clarify

The script I have here for Mac is only for VM use, since I use it only in KVM in my Fedora install, please understand if you use it in bare metal you're on your own.

I use two projects https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM and https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM to create my Mac-KVMs in Fedora and the commands in my script are from https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-optimizer.

To make the Mac-VMs work in Virt-Manager under Fedora I made these script to do it https://gist.github.com/Alecerzea/87a9530a9d16f9845cb071ae42458d99 (Its not needed in debian nor arch based distros, rare its needed with Fedora as it works without issues under the terminal)

If you wanna use gpu passthrough in any vm you create (As I use both in my Mac and Windows KVMs), use the project https://github.com/HikariKnight/quickpassthrough

I don't use either for gaming, please dont try neither Valorant nor Warzone under them (I just play them in my PS5).

My Linux config is only GNOME+AMD, NVIDIA in Linux is a headache to me  and I want Secure boot without adding a key that would mess with my kernel, and KDE i'snt my favorite desktop environment, idc about the beef of the developers, GNOME just works (and delete all the apps and dependencies I want).

I also added some shit for gaming in here that I don't know if they would work with secure boot, I have faith it would work. 

PS:It didnt XD, at least the key I needed to add doesnt mess with the kernel.
